Co-designed a digital platform aimed at supporting immigrants and international students facing mental health challenges due to cultural displacement, language barriers, and the high cost of therapy (often exceeding $10,000/year).

Built with a strong emphasis on accessibility and localization, the system includes profile management, language-based therapist matching, appointment scheduling with real-time updates, notifications, and a robust resource hub. While currently in prototype form due to deployment limitations, HomeHeart has been documented and patented under my name as a scalable mental health tech innovation.

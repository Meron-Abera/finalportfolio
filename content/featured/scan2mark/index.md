Developed an intelligent attendance tracking solution using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image-based facial recognition, backed by Django for secure and scalable backend operations. The system features a React.js frontend for a dynamic and user-friendly experience.

This project automated the traditional attendance process, significantly increasing accuracy and reducing human error and cheating in educational settings. Designed to be both scalable and intuitive, it showcases a practical application of AI in assisting real-world institutional workflows.

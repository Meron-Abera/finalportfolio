Honored by the Addis Ababa City Government Bureau of Women, Children & Social Affairs for exceptional academic achievement. Beyond the classroom, I’ve been actively engaged in tech communities such as RTC, Baddies in Tech, and Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) at AASTU. Through these roles, I mentored peers, led coding workshops, and contributed to collaborative learning environments—strengthening both my technical and leadership skills while fostering growth in others.
